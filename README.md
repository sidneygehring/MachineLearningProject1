# Income Prediction with Various Models for Comparison

## Description
This project predicts whether an individual earns more than \$50K/year based on census data. 
It explores the use of **Perceptron**, **Adaline**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, to assess which model is the most effective at producing accurate results and comparing the differences.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and encoding of categorical and numerical features
- Model training using Perceptron, Adaline, Logistic Regression, and SVM
- Visualization of decision boundaries for selected features (age vs. capital-gain)
- Hyperparameter tuning and accuracy comparison across different `C` values
- Insights into model regularization and overfitting/underfitting trade-offs
